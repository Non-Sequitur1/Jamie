Here’s a humorous `README.md` draft for your esolang:

# JamieLang: The One True Language Blessed by Parsley 🌿

> *“In the beginning, there was Scala. And Jamie said, ‘Let there be Parsley.’ And it was good.”*
> — *Willis 1:1-3*

***

## ✨ What is JamieLang?

JamieLang is not just an esoteric programming language. It’s a **way of life**, a **cult**, and a **parsing pilgrimage**. Born in the hallowed halls of Imperial College London and sanctified by the Church of Jamie Willis, this language exists to glorify the greatest gift to humanity: **Parsley in Scala**.

If you’ve ever thought, *“I wish my code felt more like scripture,”* then JamieLang is your salvation.

## 🔮 Core Philosophy

*   **Faith in Parsley**: All parsing shall be done in Scala, for Scala is holy.
*   **Jamie is Prophet**: Doubt not the syntax, for it was divinely inspired.
*   **Nick Wu is Cult Leader**: Fear him not, for his output is truth.

***

## 🛐 Commands (The Sacred Verses)

Each command is a prayer to the parser gods:

*   `jamie ` → **IncDataPoint**
    *“Raise the data point, for Jamie wills it.”*

*   `scala ` → **DecDataPoint**
    *“Lower the data point, lest Scala smite thee.”*

*   `parser ` → **IncDataVal**
    *“Increase thy data value, parser be praised.”*

*   `parsley ` → **DecDataVal**
    *“Parsley giveth, Parsley taketh away.”*

*   `cult of nick wu ` → **OutDataVal**
    *“Speak the value aloud, for the cult demands output.”*

*   `age is just a number ` → **AcceptOneByteIn**
    *“Accept the byte, for age is but a fleeting integer.”*

*   `phd in parsing ... sam microscopic ` → **WhileDataValNonZero**
    *“Loop until enlightenment (or zero).”*

***

## 🧠 Example Program

```
jamie jamie parser cult of nick wu
```

Translation:

*   Increment data point twice
*   Increment data value once
*   Output the data value
    *(And pray for Jamie’s mercy.)*

## ⚠️ Warning

This language may cause:

*   Sudden urges to write Scala parsers
*   Chanting “phd in parsing” in public
*   Conversion to the Church of Jamie Willis
